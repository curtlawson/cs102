[x] CPE 2.2 Using a capital letter where a lowercase should be
            used

[x] EPT 2.1 Avoid starting identifiers with the underscore
            character to prevent conflicts with compiler generated
            identifiers and standard library identifiers.

[x] GPP 2.5 Choosing meaningful variable names helps make a
            program self-documenting - that is, fewer comments are
            needed.

[x] GPP 2.6 The first letter of an identiifer used as a simple
            variable should be a lowercase letter. Later in the text
            we'll assign special significance to identifiers that
            begin with a capital letter and to identifiers that use
            all capital letters.

[x] GPP 2.7 Multiple-word variable names can help make a program more
            readable. Separate the words with underscores, or begin
            each word after the first with a capital letter. The
            latter style, known as camel casing, is preferred

[x] GPP 2.8 Place a space after each comma to make programs more
            readable.

[x] GPP 2.9 Place spaces on either side of a binary operator. This
            makes the operator stand out and makes the program more
            readable.

[x] CPE 2.3 A calculation in an assignment statement must be on the
            right side of the = operator. It's a compilation error to
            place a calculation on the left side of an assignment
            operator.

[x] CPE 2.4 Forgetting to precede a variable in a scanf statement
            with an ampersand (&) when that variable should, in fact,
            be preceded with an ampersand results in an execution-time
            (or run-time) error. On many systems, this cases a
            "segmentation fault" or "access violation". Such an error
            occurs when a user's program attempts to access a part of
            the computer's memory to which it does not have access
            privileges.

[x] CPE 2.5 Preceding a variable included in a printf statement with
            an ampersand when, in fact, that variable should not be
            preceded by an ampersand.
