CPE 2.2 Using a capital letter where a lowercase should be used

EPT 2.1 Avoid starting identifiers with the underscore character to
prevent conflicts with compiler generated identifiers and standard
library identifiers.

GPP 2.5 Choosing meaningful variable names helps make a program
self-documenting - that is, fewer comments are needed.

GPP 2.6 The first letter of an identiifer used as a simple variable
should be a lowercase letter. Later in the text we'll assign special
significance to identifiers that begin with a capital letter and to
identifiers that use all capital letters.

GPP 2.7 Multiple-word variable names can help make a program more
readable. Separate the words with underscores, or begin each word
after the first with a capital letter. The latter style, known as
camel casing, is preferred (???)

GPP 2.8 Place a space after each comma to make programs more readable.

GPP 2.9 Place spaces on either side of a binary operator. This makes
the operator stand out and makes the program more readable.

CPE 2.3 A calculation in an assignment statement must be on the right
side of the = operator. It's a compilation error to place a calculation
on the left side of an assignment operator.

CPE 2.4 Forgetting to precede a variable in a scanf statement with an
ampersand (&) when that variable should, in fact, be preceded with an
ampersand results in an execution-time (or run-time) error. On many
systems, this cases a "segmentation fault" or "access violation". Such
an error occurs when a user's program attempts to access a part of the
computer's memory to which it does not have access privileges.

CPE 2.5 Preceding a variable included in a printf statement with an
ampersand when, in fact, that variable should not be preceded by an
ampersand.
